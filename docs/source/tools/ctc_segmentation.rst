Dataset creation tool based on CTC-Segmentation
===============================================

This tool provides functionality to align a long audio files and the corresponding transcripts into shorter fragments
that are suitable for an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model training.

More details could be found in `this tutorial <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/tools/CTC_Segmentation_Tutorial.ipynb>`__.

The tool is based on the `CTC Segmentation <https://github.com/lumaku/ctc-segmentation>`__:
CTC-Segmentation of Large Corpora for German End-to-end Speech Recognition
