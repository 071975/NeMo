Decoherence , then , aords a way that phase information can be lost , thereby collapsing the wave function in a nonmysterious fashion . Thus , some physicists hope that decoherence provides a natural link between the quantum and classical realms .

In fact , the hypercycle is a small society of molecular replicators that help one another replicate , hence , it is a higher - order molecular replicating system .
